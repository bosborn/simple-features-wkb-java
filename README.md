#### Read ####

```java

//byte[] bytes = ...    

ByteReader reader = new ByteReader(bytes);
reader.setByteOrder(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN);
Geometry geometry = GeometryReader.readGeometry(reader);
GeometryType geometryType = geometry.getGeometryType();

```

#### Write ####

```java

//Geometry geometry = ...

ByteWriter writer = new ByteWriter();
writer.setByteOrder(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN);
GeometryWriter.writeGeometry(writer, geometry);
byte[] bytes = writer.getBytes();
writer.close();

```
